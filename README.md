Provides authentication services for Spree, using the Devise gem.


## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:

  #### Spree 3.2
  **[Note]:** Starting from version 3.2, Spree now [recommends](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/guides/content/release_notes/3_2_0.md#semantic-versioning-for-future-extensions) using the standard semantic versioning for extensions.
  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_auth_devise', '~> 3.2'
  ```

  #### Spree 3.1, 3.0 and Spree 2.x

  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_auth_devise', github: 'spree/spree_auth_devise', branch: 'X-X-stable'
  ```

  **[Only for versions < 3.2]:** The `branch` option is important: it must match the version of Spree you're using.
  For example, use `3-0-stable` if you're using Spree `3-0-stable` or any `3.0.x` version.

2. Install the gem using Bundler:
  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

3. Copy & run migrations
  ```ruby
  bundle exec rails g spree:auth:install
  ```

## Upgrading from Spree 3.0 to 3.1

If you're upgrading from 3.0 to 3.1 you need to rerun the installer to copy new asset files (javascripts)

```ruby
bundle exec rails g spree:auth:install
```

## Configuration

### Confirmable

To enable Devise's Confirmable module, which will send the user an email with a link to confirm their account, you must do the following:

* Add this line to an initializer in your Rails project (typically `config/initializers/spree.rb`):
```ruby
Spree::Auth::Config[:confirmable] = true
```

* Add a Devise initializer to your Rails project (typically `config/initializers/devise.rb`):
```ruby
Devise.setup do |config|
  # Required so users don't lose their carts when they need to confirm.
  config.allow_unconfirmed_access_for = 1.days

  # Fixes the bug where Confirmation errors result in a broken page.
  config.router_name = :spree

  # Add any other devise configurations here, as they will override the defaults provided by spree_auth_devise.
end
```

## Using in an existing Rails application

If you are installing Spree inside of a host application in which you want your own permission setup, you can do this using spree_auth_devise's register_ability method.

First create your own CanCan Ability class following the CanCan documentation.

For example: app/models/your_ability_class.rb

```ruby
class YourAbilityClass
  include CanCan::Ability

  def initialize user
    # direct permissions
     can :create, SomeRailsObject

     # or permissions by group
     if spree_user.has_spree_role? "admin"
       can :create, SomeRailsAdminObject
     end
   end
end
```

Then register your class in your spree initializer: config/initializers/spree.rb
```ruby
Spree::Ability.register_ability(YourAbilityClass)
```

Inside of your host application you can then use CanCan like you normally would.
```ruby
<% if can? :show, SomeRailsObject %>

<% end %>
```

### Adding Permissions to Gems

This methodology can also be used by gems that extend spree and want/need to add permissions.

## Testing

You need to do a quick one-time creation of a test application and then you can use it to run the tests.

    bundle exec rake test_app

Then run the rspec tests.

    bundle exec rspec
