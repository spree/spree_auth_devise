Provides authentication services for Spree, using the Devise gem.

## Installation

At one stage in the past, this used to be the auth component for Spree. If that's the feature that you're now finding lacking from Spree, that's easily fixed.

Just add this line to your `Gemfile`:
```ruby
gem 'spree_auth_devise', github: 'spree/spree_auth_devise', branch: 'master'
```

Please ensure you're using the correct branch of `spree_auth_devise` relative to your version of Spree.

Spree 1.3.x or 1-3-stable:
```ruby
gem 'spree_auth_devise', :github => 'spree/spree_auth_devise', :branch => '1-3-stable'
```

Spree 1.2.x or 1-2-stable:
```ruby
gem 'spree_auth_devise', :github => 'spree/spree_auth_devise', :branch => '1-2-stable'
```

Then run `bundle install`. Authentication will then work exactly as it did in previous versions of Spree.

If you're installing this in a new Spree 1.2+ application, you'll need to install and run the migrations with

    bundle exec rake spree_auth:install:migrations
    bundle exec rake db:migrate
    bundle exec rails g spree:auth:install

and then, run this command in order to set up the admin user for the application.

    bundle exec rake spree_auth:admin:create

## Using in an existing Rails application
If you are installing Spree inside of a host application in which you want your own permission setup, you can do this using spree_auth_devise's register_ability method.

First create your own CanCan Ability class following the CanCan documentation.

For example: app/models/your_ability_class.rb

```
class YourAbilityClass
  include CanCan::Ability

  def initialize user
    # direct permissions
     can :create, SomeRailsObject

     # or permissions by group
     if spree_user.has_spree_role? "admin"
       can :create, SomeRailsAdminObject
     end
   end

end
```

Then register your class in your spree initializer:  config/initializers/spree.rb
```
Spree::Ability.register_ability(YourAbilityClass)
```

Inside of your host application you can then use CanCan like you normally out.
```
<% if can? :show SomeRailsObject %>

<% end %>
```

###Adding Permissions to Gems
This methodology can also be used by gems that extend spree and want/need to add permissions.



## Testing

You need to do a quick one-time creation of a test application and then you can use it to run the tests.

    bundle exec rake test_app

Then run the rspec tests.

    bundle exec rake spec

If everything doesn't pass on your machine (using Ruby (1.9.3 or 2.0.0) and (MySQL or PostgreSQL or SQLite3)) then we would consider that a bug. Please file a bug report on the issues page for this project with your test output and we will investigate it.
