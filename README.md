# Spree Auth Devise

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/spree/spree_auth_devise/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/spree/spree_auth_devise/tree/main)

Provides authentication services for [Spree](https://spreecommerce.org), using the [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) gem.

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:

  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_auth_devise'
  ```
  
  if you run into any version-mismatch problems please run `bundle update`

2. Install the gem using Bundler:
  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

3. Copy & run migrations
  ```ruby
  bundle exec rails g spree:auth:install
  ```

## Upgrading from Spree 3.0 to 3.1

If you're upgrading from 3.0 to 3.1 you need to rerun the installer to copy new asset files (javascripts)

```ruby
bundle exec rails g spree:auth:install
```

## Configuration

### Confirmable

To enable Devise's Confirmable module, which will send the user an email with a link to confirm their account, you must do the following:

* Add this line to an initializer in your Rails project (typically `config/initializers/spree.rb`):
```ruby
Spree::Auth::Config[:confirmable] = true
```

* Add a Devise initializer to your Rails project (typically `config/initializers/devise.rb`):
```ruby
Devise.setup do |config|
  # Required so users don't lose their carts when they need to confirm.
  config.allow_unconfirmed_access_for = 1.days

  # Fixes the bug where Confirmation errors result in a broken page.
  config.router_name = :spree

  # Add any other devise configurations here, as they will override the defaults provided by spree_auth_devise.
end
```

### Sign out after password change

To disable signout after password change you must add this line to an initializer in your Rails project (typically `config/initializers/spree.rb`):

```ruby
Spree::Auth::Config[:signout_after_password_change] = false
```

## Using in an existing Rails application

If you are installing Spree inside of a host application in which you want your own permission setup, you can do this using spree_auth_devise's register_ability method.

First create your own CanCan Ability class following the CanCan documentation.

For example: app/models/your_ability_class.rb

```ruby
class YourAbilityClass
  include CanCan::Ability

  def initialize user
    # direct permissions
     can :create, SomeRailsObject

     # or permissions by group
     if spree_user.has_spree_role? "admin"
       can :create, SomeRailsAdminObject
     end
   end
end
```

Then register your class in your spree initializer: config/initializers/spree.rb
```ruby
Spree::Ability.register_ability(YourAbilityClass)
```

Inside of your host application you can then use CanCan like you normally would.
```ruby
<% if can? :show, SomeRailsObject %>

<% end %>
```

### Adding Permissions to Gems

This methodology can also be used by gems that extend spree and want/need to add permissions.

### Ruby 2.5 issues

If you encounter issues when using Ruby 2.5, please run:

```bash
bundle update devise
```

### Creating the default Admin user

If you didn't created the Admin user from the installer you can run this rake task:

```bash
bundle exec rake spree_auth:admin:create
```

## Testing

You need to do a quick one-time creation of a test application and then you can use it to run the tests.

    bundle exec rake test_app

Then run the rspec tests.

    bundle exec rspec
